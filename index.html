        <h1>An Erupting Valcano!</h1>
        <p>Your zest for life has led you to possess a fiery personality. The most logical step for you is to explore an errupting volcano!</p>
        <p>If you make it out alive you'll have such an interesting story to tell people that surely <em>nobody</em> would ever get tired of. No, really. Keep telling it.</p>

        <h1>Tibet...Maybe!</h1>
        <p>You are clearly too cool for school. You should probably go somewhere where you don't have to talk people. Go ahead, quit your job and become a Buddhist monk like you always threatened to.</p>
        <p>But be warned. There are very few vegan options for you out there and to make matters worse, the natives obviously don't know as much about Buddhism as you do. Be sure to educate them incessantly.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm not really sure. You're not really interesting. Idaho is a perfect spot for you since you have the personality of a potato. So go there...I guess.</p>

        <h1>Transylvania!</h1>
        <p>You sound like a vampire wannabe. You're probably in High School and write a lot of terrible fanfiction. Your favorite word is "sanguine".</p>
        <p>You also read Dracula once and thought it was boring. Yet, you tell everyone it's your favorite book anyway. You hate Twilight and you spend hours complaining about it on the internet.</p>

        <p>You seem like a nice person. You should go to Nice, where all the nice people live. There is no crime and everyone drives hovercrafts.</p>
        <p>Wait... it's pronounced like "niece"? Oh... Nevermind.</p>
