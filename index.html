  <div id="volcano">
    <h1 class="center">An Erupting Valcano!</h1>
    <p>Your zest for life has led you to possess a fiery personality. The most logical step for you is to explore an errupting volcano!</p>
    <p>If you make it out alive you'll have such an interesting story to tell people that surely <em>nobody</em> would ever get tired of. No, really. Keep telling it.</p>

  <div id="tibet">
    <h1 class="center">Tibet...Maybe!</h1>
    <p>You are clearly too cool for school. You should probably go somewhere where you don't have to talk people. Go ahead, quit your job and become a Buddhist monk like you always threatened to.</p>
    <p>But be warned. There are very few vegan options for you out there and to make matters worse, the natives obviously don't know as much about Buddhism as you do. Be sure to educate them incessantly.</p>

  <div id="idaho">
    <h1 class="center">Somewhere in Idaho</h1>
    <p>Yeah, I'm not really sure. You're not really interesting. Idaho is a perfect spot for you since you have the personality of a potato. So go there...I guess.</p>
